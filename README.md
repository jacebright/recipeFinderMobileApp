# Overview

As an aspiring Software Engineer, I am continuing to seek greater knowledge and skills, and this project is my first Mobile app that I have developed.

This Recipe Finder app is simple. It allows a user to select a category of food (ie. "American", "Hispanic", "Dessert", "Beverage", etc), and have a variety of food ideas pop up as suggested dishes.

I created this app as a segue into learning more about Android app development. It allowed me to gain a greater understanding of the Kotlin Language and gain a greater appreciation of the skill that goes into 
creating a good mobile app.
